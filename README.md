## Code Katas

This repo contains various 'code katas' I've done as a way to practice
coding or just for kicks.  

Each directory contains a different kata or project.  And most projects
are documented using the 'rocco' gem, so you can just view the
documentation by checking out a copy of the repo and viewing the HTML
files in your web browser.
