## My Programming Katas

This repo contains various 'code katas' I've done as a way to practice
coding or just for kicks.

Each directory contains different katas or projects from different
sources.  The more complicated projects are documented using the 'rocco' gem, so you can just view the
documentation by checking out a copy of the repo and viewing the HTML
files in your web browser.
