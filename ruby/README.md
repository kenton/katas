## My Ruby Programming Katas

This repo contains various 'code katas' I've done as a way to practice
coding or just for kicks.

These are all done in ruby.

The more complicated ruby projects are documented using the 'rocco' gem, so you can just view the
documentation by checking out a copy of the repo and viewing the HTML
files in your web browser.
